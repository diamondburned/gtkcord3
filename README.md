## It's time to ditch the Discord Electron application (soon).

- Lighter than the official Discord application
- Faster than the official Discord application
- Uses less system resources than the official Discord application
- Is just as easy to use as the official Discord application
- Uses your preferred GTK theme

## Build gtkcord
**Required:** `go` (1.13+), `gtk`, `libhandy0`, `pkgconfig` (refer to `shell.nix`)

```sh
go get github.com/diamondburned/gtkcord3 # auto updates
~/go/bin/gtkcord3 # $GOPATH/bin/gtkcord3 or $GOBIN/gtkcord3
```

## Logging in

![Login screen](.readme-resources/images/login.png)

### Using [DiscordLogin](https://github.com/diamondburned/discordlogin) (recommended)

1. Click the DiscordLogin button.
2. Install DiscordLogin if you have to.
3. Login normally.

### Manually

1. Press F12 in when Discord is open (to open the Inspector).
2. Go to the Network tab then press F5 to refresh the page.
3. Search `api library` then look for the "Authorization" header in the right column.
5. Copy this token into the Token field, then click Login.
