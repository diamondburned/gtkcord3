## It's time to ditch the Discord Electron application (soon).

- Lighter than the official Discord application
- Faster than the official Discord application
- Uses less system resources than the official Discord application
- Is just as easy to use as the official Discord application
- Uses your prefered GTK theme

## Build gtkcord
**Required:** `go` (1.13+), `gtk`


### 1. Set the TOKEN variable to your Discord key

(The developer of gtkcord is currently working on a login, so that you no longer need to set the TOKEN variable.)

You can find this key by:
- Press F12 in when Discord is open (to open the Inspector).
- Press F5 to refresh the page and go to the Network tab.
- Search `api library` and look for the "Authorization" header in the right column.
- Copy this token.

### 2. Compile and run GtkCord

```sh
export TOKEN="<your copied token here>"
go run .
```
